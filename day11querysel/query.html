      The Document Object Model (DOM) connects web pages to scripts or
      programming languages by representing the structure of a document—such as
      the HTML representing a web page—in memory. Usually it refers to
      JavaScript, even though modeling HTML, SVG, or XML documents as objects
      are not part of the core JavaScript language. The DOM represents a
      document with a logical tree. Each branch of the tree ends in a node, and
      each node contains objects. DOM methods allow programmatic access to the
      tree. With them, you can change the document's structure, style, or
      content. Nodes can also have event handlers attached to them. Once an
      event is triggered, the event handlers get executed.

    <h1>hello from heaading</h1>
    <button>Click me</button>

    <script>
      const para = document.querySelectorAll("p");
      // console.log(para.textContent);

      for (let i = 0; i < para.length; i++) {
        para[i].innerText = ` item ${i + 1}`;
      }

      let btn = document.querySelector("button");
      console.log(btn);

      btn.addEventListener("click", click);

      function click() {
        let heading = document.querySelector("h1");
        heading.style.color = "green";
      }
    </script>
